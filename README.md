# Machine learning titanic dataset

Building machine learning models to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of titanic.

Performed data cleaning and exploration.

## Models built

1. Logistic regression
2. Support vector machines
3. Multi layer perceptrons
4. Random forests

Hyperparameters for models were tuned using k-fold cross validation on train set.

Performance was checked on validation set to avoid over fitting.

## Compared models

Models built were comapared using precision, recall and accuracy scores.
